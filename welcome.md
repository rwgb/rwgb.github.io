## A New Digital Home

After months of planning, I'm excited to finally launch my personal website! This is a dedicated space to share my work, thoughts, and tutorials.

## What You'll Find Here

### 📝 Technical Blog Posts

I'll be writing in-depth tutorials, guides, and explorations of topics I'm passionate about:
- Software development best practices
- Deep dives into technologies I use daily
- Lessons learned from real projects
- Tips and tricks I wish I knew earlier

### 🚀 Project Showcases

All my projects - both personal and open source - will be documented here with:
- Detailed descriptions and architecture
- Links to source code and demos
- The story behind each project
- What I learned building them

### 🎥 Video Content

I create educational content, and I'll be complementing those videos with:
- Written versions of tutorials
- Code snippets and resources
- Extended content
- Updates on upcoming videos

## Why This Site?

I wanted a central hub where everything lives together. GitHub is great for code, but I needed a space to:

1. **Write longer-form content** without platform restrictions
2. **Own my content** fully
3. **Have complete creative control** over design and layout
4. **Create a portfolio** that represents me

## The Tech Stack

For those curious, this site is built with:
- **Hugo** - Static site generator for blazing fast performance
- **Congo Theme** - Beautiful, dark-mode-first design
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting with automatic deployments
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline for smooth updates

The entire site is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/rwgb/rwgb.github.io), so feel free to learn from it or fork it!

## Let's Build Together

This website is more than just a personal project - it's a space for our community. I want to hear from you:

- What topics would you like me to cover?
- What projects would you like to see?
- What problems are you trying to solve?
